# BadApple-CL Animation

This is a C++ program that makes an animation in the terminal window. The animation is based on the Bad Apple animation. This program uses the OpenCV library to do PNG image processing to get the pixel data and plot it on the terminal window.
The link to all the Bad Apple frames that I used will be here. https://archive.org/details/bad_apple_is.7z 
When getting the Bad Apple frames from the link, it will be in a .7z file. Make sure you have a .7z converter program or you get use a online .7z converter.
